# DnDFireballProject
Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D) is a renowned table-top role-playing game noted for its complex combat encounters. These encounters determine the adventure's trajectory and vary in difficulty. However, the existing system to gauge encounter difficulty, known as challenge-rating, has significant limitations and fails to address the nuances of combat dynamics. To remedy this, we embarked on a data-driven exploration using FIREBALL: a dataset comprising 25,000 real gameplay combat encounters collected via the Avrae Discord bot. We aimed to develop a more sophisticated tool to assist Dungeon Masters (DMs) in crafting balanced and engaging encounters.

ADD requirements to run the scripts

ADD dependencies of each script like: extractor (does what) run first on raw data, then run filtering on the csv produced by extractor, then run scaling on the csv produced by filtering. so it is clear how to reproduce the results.
Then brief descriptions of all the modeling files and that they run on final csv file.
