ADD requirements to run the scripts

ADD dependencies of each script like: extractor (does what) run first on raw data, then run filtering on the csv produced by extractor, then run scaling on the csv produced by filtering. so it is clear how to reproduce the results.
Then brief descriptions of all the modeling files and that they run on final csv file.
